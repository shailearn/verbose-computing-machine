This is a project in which an LSTM model is created to predict the stock price of Tesla using historical stock data. The project uses Python and TensorFlow to build the model and handle the data. The data is loaded from a CSV file and preprocessed before being split into training and testing sets. The model is created and trained using the training set, and predictions are made on the testing set. Finally, the predicted values are plotted against the actual values, and the mean absolute error and R2 score are printed. The project requires knowledge of Python, data preprocessing, LSTM, and TensorFlow.
